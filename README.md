This is a small tool to retrieve the closest train station or bus or tram stop nearby in Switzerland. Based on the user's geolocation it retrieves a list of stations. For each station the user can see the next connections. The timetable data is retrieved from the Transport API (transport.opendata.ch). This has been a weekend project I did some 3-4 years ago. Please find here a published version: http://nearby.alexandermuedespacher.ch
